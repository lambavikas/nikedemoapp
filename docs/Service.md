# Create a CAP-Based Service

In this part, you create a new CAP-based service, which exposes the OData V4 protocol. To do so, you use CAP's tooling `cds init` and `cds watch` in a command-line interface.

## Create and Initialize the Project

1. Open a terminal.
2. Create a directory ```<myDirectory>``` on your computer, where you want to develop the app.
3. Navigate to that directory.
  ```
  cd <myDirectory>
  ```
4. Create an initial CAP project by executing the command `cds init`. It creates the project in a new folder called ```cpapp```.
  ```
  cds init cpapp
  ```
5.  Enter the project folder.
  ```
  cd cpapp
  ```

6. Open a Terminal window

8. In the terminal, start a CAP server.
    ```
    cds watch
    ```
  
    The CAP server serves all the CAP sources from your project. It also "watches" all the files in your projects and conveniently restarts whenever you save a file. Changes you've made will immediately be served without you having to do anything.

    The CAP server tells you that thereâ€™s no model yet that it can serve. You add one in the next steps which are now shown in individual feature branches.
